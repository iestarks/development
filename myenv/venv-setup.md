iestarks: create a python to setup authenticating infoblox with service now api

GitHub Copilot: To authenticate Infoblox with the ServiceNow API, you'll need to use the requests library in Python. Here's a basic example of how you might set this up:

```python
import requests
from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth

# Infoblox and ServiceNow details
infoblox_url = 'https://infoblox.example.com/wapi/v2.7/'
servicenow_url = 'https://devXXXXX.service-now.com/api/now/table/incident'
infoblox_username = '

inf

oblox_username'
infoblox_password = 'infoblox_password'
servicenow_username = 'servicenow_username'
servicenow_password = 'servicenow_password'

# Authenticate with Infoblox
infoblox_auth = HTTPBasicAuth(infoblox_username, infoblox_password)
infoblox_response = requests.get(infoblox_url, auth=infoblox_auth)

# Authenticate with ServiceNow
servicenow_auth = HTTPBasicAuth(servicenow_username, servicenow_password)
headers = {"Content-Type":"application/json","Accept":"application/json"}
servicenow_response = requests.get(servicenow_url, auth=servicenow_auth, headers=headers)

# Check the responses
if infoblox_response.status_code == 200:
    print("Authenticated with Infoblox successfully.")
else:
    print("Failed to authenticate with Infoblox.")

if servicenow_response.status_code == 200:
    print("Authenticated with ServiceNow successfully.")
else:
    print("Failed to authenticate with ServiceNow.")
```

Please replace `'infoblox.example.com'`, `'devXXXXX.service-now.com'`, and the usernames and passwords with your actual details. This script will authenticate with both Infoblox and ServiceNow and print a message indicating whether each authentication was successful.

Remember to install the `requests` library if you haven't already done so. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install requests
```

Please note that this is a basic example and does not include error handling or other best practices for production code.

iestarks: podman command to run docker container image on port 8081 

GitHub Copilot: To run a Docker container image using Podman on port 8081, you can use the following command:

```bash
podman run -p 8081:8081 your_image_name
```

In this command, `-p 8081:8081` maps the container's port 8081 to your host's port 8081. Replace `your_image_name` with the name of your Docker image.

Please ensure that Podman is installed and properly configured on your system before running this command.

iestarks: podman command to run docker image with IB_GUI_PASSWORD

GitHub Copilot: To run a Docker container image using Podman and set an environment variable such as `IB_GUI_PASSWORD`, you can use the `-e` option followed by the environment variable and its value. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
podman run -e IB_GUI_PASSWORD=your_password -p 8081:8081 your_image_name
```

In this command, `-e IB_GUI_PASSWORD=your_password` sets the `IB_GUI_PASSWORD` environment variable to `your_password`. Replace `your_password` with the actual password you want to use, and replace `your_image_name` with the name of your Docker image.

Please ensure that Podman is installed and properly configured on your system before running this command.

iestarks: podman command to run docker image with password and port 8081 with image named bdd7881f1066

GitHub Copilot: To run a Docker container image using Podman, set an environment variable such as `IB_GUI_PASSWORD`, and map the container's port to your host's port 8081, you can use the following command:

```bash
podman run -e IB_GUI_PASSWORD=your_password -p 8081:8081 bdd7881f1066
```

In this command, `-e IB_GUI_PASSWORD=your_password` sets the `IB_GUI_PASSWORD` environment variable to `your_password`. Replace `your_password` with the actual password you want to use. `-p 8081:8081` maps the container's port 8081 to your host's port 8081. `bdd7881f1066` is the name of your Docker image.

Please ensure that Podman is installed and properly configured on your system before running this command.

iestarks: create python script to create azure vm in subscription starksenterprise using  resource group called vmresource-grp, using virtual network called starksenterprise-vnet  

GitHub Copilot: To create an Azure VM using Python, you'll need to use the Azure SDK for Python. Here's a basic example of how you might set this up:

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.resource import ResourceManagementClient
from azure.mgmt.network import NetworkManagementClient
from azure.mgmt.compute import ComputeManagementClient
from azure.mgmt.compute.models import DiskCreateOption

# Azure details
subscription_id = 'starksenterprise'
resource_group = 'vmresource-grp'
vnet_name = 'starksenterprise-vnet'
vm_name = 'your_vm_name'  # replace with your VM name

# Get credentials
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

# Create clients
resource_client = ResourceManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)
network_client = NetworkManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)
compute_client = ComputeManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)

# Create VM
vm_parameters = {
    'location': 'westus',  # replace with your location
    'hardware_profile': {
        'vm_size': 'Standard_D2_v2'  # replace with your VM size
    },
    'storage_profile': {
        'image_reference': {
            'publisher': 'MicrosoftWindowsServer',
            'offer': 'WindowsServer',
            'sku': '2016-Datacenter',
            'version': 'latest'
        }
    },
    'network_profile': {
        'network_interfaces': [{
            'id': network_client.network_interfaces.get(
                resource_group,
                'your_nic_name'  # replace with your network interface card name
            ).id
        }]
    },
    'os_profile': {
        'computer_name': vm_name,
        'admin_username': 'your_username',  # replace with your username
        'admin_password': 'your_password'  # replace with your password
    }
}

operation = compute_client.virtual_machines.begin_create_or_update(
    resource_group,
    vm_name,
    vm_parameters
)

operation.wait()
```

Please replace `'your_vm_name'`, `'your_nic_name'`, `'your_username'`, `'your_password'`, and the VM size and location with your actual details. This script will create a VM in the specified resource group and virtual network.

Remember to install the Azure SDK for Python if you haven't already done so. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install azure-mgmt-resource azure-mgmt-network azure-mgmt-compute azure-identity
```

Please note that this is a basic example and does not include error handling or other best practices for production code.

iestarks: setup python venv

GitHub Copilot: To set up a Python virtual environment (venv), you can follow these steps:

1. First, navigate to the directory where you want to create the virtual environment. You can do this using the `cd` command in your terminal.

2. Once you're in the desired directory, run the following command to create a new virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv myenv
```

Replace `myenv` with the name you want to give to your virtual environment.

3. After creating the virtual environment, you need to activate it. The command to do this depends on your operating system:

On macOS and Linux:

```bash
source myenv/bin/activate
```

On Windows:

```cmd
.\myenv\Scripts\activate
```

Once the virtual environment is activated, your terminal prompt will change to show the name of the activated environment. At this point, you can start installing packages into the isolated environment. When you're done, you can deactivate the environment by simply typing `deactivate` in your terminal.
